/*
By definition, a promise is an object that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation.

A promise object has a state that can be one of the following:

Pending
Fulfilled with a value
Rejected for a reason
In the beginning, the state of a promise is pending, indicating that the asynchronous operation is in progress.
 Depending on the result of the asynchronous operation, the state changes to either fulfilled or rejected.

The fulfilled state indicates that the asynchronous operation was completed successfully:
